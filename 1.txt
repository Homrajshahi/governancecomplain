Digital Complaint Management System (React +
Django REST Framework)
1. Introduction
With the increasing shift toward digital services and e-governance, there is a
growing need for transparent, secure, and eﬀicient online systems that allow cit-
izens to report issues and track their resolution. Traditional complaint handling
systems are mostly manual, time-consuming, and lack accountability.
The Digital Complaint Management System is a web-based application
developed using React for the frontend and Python with Django REST
Framework (DRF) for the backend. The system enables users to submit
complaints digitally and allows authorities (admins) to review, manage, and
resolve them eﬀiciently.
This project is designed to be beginner to intermediate level, while following
real-world industry architecture where frontend and backend are separated.
2. Problem Statement
Many organizations and public oﬀices still rely on manual methods for handling
complaints, such as paper forms or verbal reporting. These approaches lead to:
• Delays in complaint resolution
• Lack of transparency
• Poor record management
• No proper tracking mechanism for users
A centralized digital platform is required to automate complaint registration,
tracking, and resolution.
3. Objectives of the Project
The objectives of this project are:
• To provide an online platform for complaint submission
• To reduce manual paperwork and delays
• To ensure transparency in complaint handling
• To allow role-based access for users and administrators
• To help students understand full-stack development using React and DRF
4. Scope of the Project
The system can be applied in:
• Colleges and universities
• Local government oﬀices
• Community-level issue reporting
1
• Small organizations
The project focuses on core functionalities and can be extended to a full e-
governance system in the future.
5. System Architecture
The application follows a client–server architecture:
• Frontend: React.js (User Interface)
• Backend: Django REST Framework (API & Business Logic)
• Database: PostgreSQL (Primary data storage)
The frontend communicates with the backend using RESTful APIs over HTTP.
6. User Roles
6.1 User (Citizen / Student)
• Register and login
• Submit complaints
• View submitted complaints
• Track complaint status
6.2 Admin (Authority)
• Secure login
• View all complaints
• Update complaint status
• Add remarks or resolution notes
7. Functional Requirements
User Functionalities
• User registration and authentication using JWT
• Submit complaints with title, category, and description
• View complaint history
• Track status (Pending, In Progress, Resolved)
Admin Functionalities
• View all complaints
• Update complaint status
• Manage complaint records
8. Non-Functional Requirements
• Secure authentication and authorization
2
• Responsive user interface
• Reliable data storage
• Scalable backend architecture
• User-friendly design
9. Technology Stack and Tools
Frontend
• React.js
• JavaScript
• HTML and CSS (Tailwind CSS optional)
• Axios for API communication
Backend
• Python
• Django
• Django REST Framework
• JWT Authentication
Database
• PostgreSQL
10. Database Design
10.1 User Table
• id
• name
• email
• password
• role (user/admin)
10.2 Complaint Table
• id
• user_id (Foreign Key)
• title
• description
• category
• status
• created_at
11. Application Workflow
1. User registers and logs in
3
2. User submits a complaint
3. Complaint status is set to “Pending”
4. Admin reviews the complaint
5. Admin updates the status
6. User views updated status
12. Project Division (Team Work)
Member 1 – Backend Developer (Python + DRF)
• Database design
• API development
• Authentication and authorization
• Admin logic
Member 2 – Frontend Developer (React)
• UI design
• React components and routing

• Analytics and reporting dashboard
• Cloud deployment
14. Advantages of the System
• Reduces paperwork
• Improves transparency
• Faster complaint resolution
• Secure and scalable
• Easy to use
15. Conclusion
The Digital Complaint Management System developed using React and Django
REST Framework provides a practical solution for digital complaint handling.
It demonstrates how modern web technologies can be used to build scalable,
secure, and transparent systems. This project also serves as a strong foundation
for advanced applications in e-governance and cloud-based systems.
